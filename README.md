# TweetCloud Maker

## Overview

This web app is made using `Streamlit`, a python module 
widely known for making data science web app. It's 
principally a wrapper/interface for two python modules:
+ `snscrape`, which is used to scrape the tweets,
+ `wordcloud`, which is used to create the twitter bird-shaped wordcloud.
